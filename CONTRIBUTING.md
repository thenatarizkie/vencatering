# Explanation on How to Contribute

Thank you for being interested in contributing to this project! I really appreciate contributions, be it in the form of bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to improve or add new features. This project is far from perfect, and I believe with the help of the community, we can make it better. Feel free to make changes and submit pull requests.

Since this is an open source project that I developed myself, there are still many features that can be improved or added. Any input or contribution from you is very valuable and will greatly help in improving the quality of this project. Thank you very much for your support!

## Steps To Contribute

- Fork it ( https://github.com/thenatarizkie/vencatering )
- Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
- Run eslint and prettierrc first (`npm run lint:fix`)
- Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add some new feature'`)
- Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
- Create a new pull request

## Notes To Contribute

All changes need to be made in the source files located in the `src` folder and don't commit generated files from your dist folder.

- Make sure the codebase builds and passes all tests before submitting your pull request
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- If you make changes to the code, update the corresponding documentation
- Your code should follow the projectâ€™s coding style

Always run a build and test the results before committing.
